# Lab_Session5


## Audience: 
The Prospective students 

## Need of the Audience: 
Audience need to decide about the best fit college keeping in mind all the key metrics provided.

## What does Audience want: 
The information we are trying to provide, must really come out of the visualization at one go. The Viz must be visually impressive and direct in displaying information.

## Fears of the Audience: 
While viewing my visualization, the prospective students might think that what if these statistics are not from a reliable source. What if websites of other colleges are showing good metrics for their stats.

## Substitutes: 
Recommendations from Alumni or Faculty. Searching websites of many colleges and taking help of counsellors.
